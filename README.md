# PRODIGY_ML_03
We have Implemented a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset

# Dataset
Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data. You will find the photos used in the SVM model for train and test.

# Steps for using the dataset
1. Download the train and test zip files from the above given website link.
2. Upload them to your drive in a folder called Datasets to make things easier.
3. Then open Google Colab.
4. Add a Code cell above the given code in the ipynb file to mount your Google drive.
5. Then use the code given in the .ipynb file.

# Code Execution
The code is inside the SVM_Cat_vs_Dog_Classification.ipynb file. Do the above steps and then execute the code given. The SVM is trained on the photos contained in the train and test files.

# Knowledge Gained
**1. Understanding of Image Preprocessing:** Learned techniques for preprocessing image data, including resizing, grayscaling, and flattening images to make them suitable for machine learning models.
Gained experience in handling different image formats and organizing data effectively for model training.

**2. Data Handling and Augmentation:** Acquired skills in loading and managing image datasets, including extracting and managing labels from filenames.
Addressed issues related to class imbalance and dataset preparation, understanding the importance of having a balanced dataset for classification tasks.

**3. Implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Implemented an SVM classifier using scikit-learn to distinguish between two classes (cats and dogs).
Gained practical experience with various SVM kernels, particularly the linear kernel, and explored their effect on model performance.

**4. Model Evaluation and Metrics:** Learned how to evaluate the performance of the SVM model using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.
Understood the importance of model evaluation in assessing the effectiveness of classification algorithms.

**5. Label Encoding and Handling:** Gained experience in encoding categorical labels into numerical format using LabelEncoder, which is essential for training machine learning models with categorical data.

**6. Error Handling and Debugging:** Developed skills in debugging and handling errors related to data loading, preprocessing, and model training.
Identified and resolved issues related to data inconsistencies and class imbalances.

7. Practical Application of Machine Learning Techniques: Applied theoretical concepts of machine learning and SVMs to a real-world image classification problem, bridging the gap between theory and practical application. Enhanced understanding of the end-to-end process of training and evaluating machine learning models.

8. Experience with Google Colab and Cloud Storage: Utilized Google Colab for implementing and running the code, gaining experience with cloud-based tools and integrating them with cloud storage solutions.
